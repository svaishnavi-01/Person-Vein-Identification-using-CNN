Person Vein Identification using CNN
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Person Vein (Finger Vein) Identification System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and Machine Learning classification.
Vein-based biometrics are highly secure because vein patterns are internal and unique to each person.
